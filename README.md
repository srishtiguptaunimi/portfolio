## Projects
### Urban Sound Classification - Neural Network | 2023
Developed, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model specifically for sound classification tasks. Through rigorous testing, I compared its performance with traditional machine learning models. The Neural Network model achieved an impressive 76% classification accuracy, showcasing its superior capabilities over conventional methods.

### Customer Segmentation - Unsupervised Learning | 2023
Conducted an in-depth analysis of a supermarket sales dataset to uncover unique customer segments. Leveraging advanced multivariate statistics and clustering methods, unearthed hidden patterns and identified consumer groups based on their purchasing habits. By crafting actionable insights, devised tailored marketing strategies aimed at each customer segment. These strategies emphasize personalized communication, product suggestions, and targeted promotional initiatives to enhance engagement and drive sales.

### UK Housing Market and the effect of Monetary Policy | 2022
Conducted analysis on the UK housing market to identify its profound impact on both the economy and individuals. Collected, pre-processed quarterly data spanning from 1975 to 2020. Unraveled the intricate relationship between house prices and monetary policy. The findings unveiled long-term associations, particularly emphasizing the influence of interbank rates on house prices. The skills employed during this analysis included Eviews, Econometric modeling, and the derivation of quantitative insights. 

### U.S Auto Car Sales Demand Analysis | 2022
Executed an in-depth analysis of U.S. Auto Car Sales Demand by formulating a comprehensive model to assess the demand for new cars in the U.S. automotive market. Investigated the factors driving the escalation of car prices and evaluated potential policy implications concerning environmental regulations. Aligned research findings with the fundamental principles of the Law of Demand and Supply. Unearthed unexpected short and long-term price elasticities, diverging from established research paradigms. Leveraged expertise in STATA, Econometric modeling, Demand Supply Analysis, and Price Elasticity Assessment to effectively conduct and interpret the analysis.
