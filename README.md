## Projects
### Urban Sound Classification - Neural Network | 2023
Developed, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model specifically for sound classification tasks. Through rigorous testing, I compared its performance with traditional machine learning models. The Neural Network model achieved an impressive 76% classification accuracy, showcasing its superior capabilities over conventional methods.

### Customer Segmentation - Unsupervised Learning | 2023
Conducted an in-depth analysis of a supermarket sales dataset to uncover unique customer segments. Leveraging advanced multivariate statistics and clustering methods, unearthed hidden patterns and identified consumer groups based on their purchasing habits. By crafting actionable insights, devised tailored marketing strategies aimed at each customer segment. These strategies emphasize personalized communication, product suggestions, and targeted promotional initiatives to enhance engagement and drive sales.
